# Exif

Here is the problem, that you must find serveral exif data.

So first download the file (picture)

after that, you should check if exiftool is installed on your machine, if not, then install it :)

so now execute the command ```exif Filename....```

then there is an output with serveral info.

Under "Owner Name" there is the flag:

flag{3l1t3_3x1f_4uth0r1ty_dud3br0}

e voila :)
